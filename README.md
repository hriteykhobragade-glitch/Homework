## Breast Cancer Classification Demo

This small Python project trains and evaluates three classification models on the built-in scikit-learn breast cancer dataset.

What the project does
- Loads the `load_breast_cancer` dataset from scikit-learn.
- Splits the data into train and test sets (80/20, `random_state=42`).
- Scales features for Logistic Regression using `StandardScaler`.
- Trains three models:
  - Logistic Regression (with feature scaling)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Prints evaluation metrics for each model: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and the Confusion Matrix.

What to expect
- The script trains three models and prints performance metrics to the console. The Logistic Regression model uses feature scaling; the tree-based models are trained on the raw features in `main.py`.
- Example output (truncated) — you'll see three blocks, one per model, similar to:

```
Logistic Regression Performance:
Accuracy: 0.9649
Precision: 0.9714
Recall: 0.9623
F1 Score: 0.9668
Confusion Matrix:
[[39  1]
 [ 3 71]]
```

Notes and small improvements
- You can optionally scale features before training tree-based models, but tree models typically don't require scaling.
- To reproduce exact results, the script already fixes `random_state=42` for train/test split and for tree/forest models.
